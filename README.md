# The-collection

## Challenge description
 The goal of this project will be to summarize our current knowledge of :
 - HTML and CSS
 - Responsive design
 - Javascript Basics
 - The DOM
to create a collection of items. This project will be split up in two parts.
Time for this challenge : 2 days

## Project description

We made an array and we inject elements from this array in our html. My project here is a collection of my favourite movies i tried to do all the bonusses but my sorting buttons by genre create a 'conflict' with my delete buttons so i need to think through again how to make that sorting function (it 'works' but not really as expected). We had some fooling around with the animations.
